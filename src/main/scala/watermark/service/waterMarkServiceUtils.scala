/*
 A global publishing company that publishes books and journals wants to develop
 a service to watermark their documents.

 -A document (books, journals) has a title, author and a watermark property. +
 -An empty watermark property indicates that the document has not been watermarked yet. +
 -Book publications include topics in business, science and media. +
 -Journals donâ€™t include any specific topics. +
 -The watermark service has to be asynchronous. +
 -For a given content document the service should return a ticket
  which can be used to poll the status of processing. +
 -If the watermarking is finished the document can be retrieved with the ticket. +
 -The watermark of a book or a journal is identified by setting the watermark property of the object. +
 -For a book the watermark includes the properties content, title, author and topic. +
 -The journal watermark includes the content, title and author. +

 Create an appropriate object-oriented model for the problem. +
 Implement the Watermark-Service, meeting the above conditions. +
 Provide Unit-Tests to ensure the functionality of the service. +
